  description: 'FreeClimb is a cloud-based application programming interface (API)
    that puts the power of the Vail platform in your hands. FreeClimb simplifies the
    process of creating applications that can use a full range of telephony features
    without requiring specialized or on-site telephony equipment. Using the FreeClimb
    REST API to write applications is easy! You have the option to use the language
    of your choice or hit the API directly. Your application can execute a command
    by issuing a RESTful request to the FreeClimb API. The base URL to send HTTP requests
    to the FreeClimb REST API is: /apiserver. FreeClimb authenticates and processes
    your request.'
