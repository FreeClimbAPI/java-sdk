# TerminateConference

The `TerminateConference` command terminates an existing Conference. Any active participants are hung up on by FreeClimb. If this is not the desired behavior, use the `RemoveFromConference` command to unbridge Calls that should not be hung up. Note: The Call requesting TerminateConference must be on the same Conference for this command to execute.
