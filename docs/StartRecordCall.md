# StartRecordCall

The `StartRecordCall` command records the current call and returns the URL of a file containing the audio recording when recording completes. `StartRecordCall` is non-blocking. After recording of the current call begins, control of the call moves to the PerCL command that follows `StartRecordCall` in the current PerCL script.
